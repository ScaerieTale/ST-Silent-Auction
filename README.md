# ST-Silent-Auction Script
## A 100 Days of Code Project
The idea behind a Silent Auction is that each bidder places their bid and name without knowledge of what any other bidders have entered.  It's a blind auction.

This script is part of Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Python course on Udemy.  Unlike some previous projects where I utilized Dr. Yu's skeleton code as a blueprint, I'm going to be attempting to build this project from scratch, taking what I know of Python and trying to emulate her results completely on my own.

We'll see how that goes ;)
