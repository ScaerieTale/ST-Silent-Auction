# ST-Silent-Auction Script
## A 100 Days of Code Project
The idea behind a Silent Auction is that each bidder places their bid and name without knowledge of what any other bidders have entered.  It's a blind auction.

This script is part of Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Python course on Udemy.  Unlike some previous projects where I utilized Dr. Yu's skeleton code as a blueprint, I'm going to be attempting to build this project from scratch, taking what I know of Python and trying to emulate her results completely on my own.

We'll see how that goes ;)
# UPDATE
Well this was unexpected.  My code is dang near 100% identical to Dr. Yu's, even though the lesson itself was about manipulating dictionaries to do nested dictionaries and lists lol.

I'm still having a problem getting the while loop to stop when it's supposed to, and I don't have access to the clear function she uses in Replit because I'm using VSCode, but I'm pretty proud of myself for getting the rest correct.

I even solved the string-integer problem she showcases as part of the lesson :D
